* Book template in org-mode that uses the svmono class

** What is this for?

Many academic scientists and engineers maintain notebooks of information in LaTeX documents.
They want to capture their insights and new knowledge in a place organized in a hierarchy.
They would like to be able to retrieve that information quickly via autogenerated table of contents, lists, index, and a PDF of their book document.

Furthermore, they might have the vain hope of publishing this book someday, but most notebooks are used only for self-study.
Once the skeleton of the book document has been assembled, its style can be easily changed by changing the class to meet the needs of a specific publisher.
Usually, these notebooks require a great deal of time and energy to rewrite their prose to be suitable for publication.
Usually, the incentive for doing so is too weak compared to other pressures and priorities.
Very often, assembling the material is the limit of the self-study.
This is sufficient for the moment's needs, such as mastering a new skill to be deployed in a new project.

You could use this org-mode book as a template to assemble a dissertation.
Many universities require you to use a specific LaTeX class because they want a uniform style across all dissertations assembled with LaTeX. 
You can adapt this template by changing document classes in the preamble of the main.org file.
It will probably take a lot of pressure from below to get them to add support for org-mode.
Part of the problem is that few librarians know how to use LaTeX let alone org-mode.
Just change the class name in the Preamble drawer and follow the directions below to add a new class to the list of available classes in the variable ~org-latex-classes~.

** Why not use the default book class in org-mode?

I found that the default book template has too many limitations.
I found that the svmono class best met my needs. 
It is the class used by the publisher Springer.
You must add the *svmono* class to the variable *org-latex-classes* after entering M-x customize.
See the image below for guidance.
This step will take five minutes.

** Needs that are met by this template

I needed to be able to scroll through the book's PDF quickly.
Many other file formats scroll badly once they reach a certain length.
Even an org document can be problematic when a document has hundreds of headlines.
I would never try to assemble a book from a single org file.
Instead, I use a central main.org to include individual chapters in separate document files.

This modular approach can isolate problematic chapters by commenting them out in the master *main.org* document.
This allows you to proceed with compiling the document until you have time to deal with whatever exists in that problematic file.
The PDF and plain text files do not have those issues.

Finding a good template for generating such a book was a chore ten years ago.
It took me days to develop a book template in LaTeX.
I have used the LaTeX template over 100 times to start book projects on Overleaf.

I wanted a book style allowing narrow margins to minimize paper consumption.
I needed a book with auto-generated tables of contents, indices of terms, and indices of authors.
I also wanted a book that would support the generation of lists of figures, tables, equations, and code listings.
Likewise, I wanted to be able to generate glossaries of acronyms, symbols, and terms.
Unfortunately, computer memory limits how many kinds of lists and indices you can use simultaneously in a single book document.
You may have to select a subset.

I have ported my favorite LaTeX book template to org-mode because many org users are uncomfortable using pure LaTeX.
This template depends upon the *svmono.cls*.
It took me about a day to discover that I had to customize the org-latex-classes variable by adding svmono as a class.
After I had completed this operation, the PDF would be compiled correctly with narrow margins and indices.
The image below shows a snapshot of the customization menu.
The top entry is for one of the default formats, of which there are three: article, book, and report.
The bottom entry shows the one for *svmono*.

My Approach is to use a *0AAAmain.org* file as the central node of the book. 
It includes statements to import individual chapters and appendices, which are also chapters but enumerated with letters.
The chapters and appendices are stored in a *Contents* subfolder.
They are named *Chwhatever.org*.

If the chapters are grouped into parts, I may indicate membership of a part by using a number in front of `Ch'.
I tend to do this when there are 20 or more chapters.

The images are stored in a figs sub-sub folder.
The code listings are stored in a subsubfolder named codeListings 

The file *0AAAmain.org* is the analog of *main.tex* in LaTeX multiple-part documents.
This filename appears near the top of the list of files in a directory.
This eases the rediscovery of this master file.
You will have to edit this file as you add more chapters.

I store the LaTeX preamble of almost 200 lines inside a drawer.
This preamble imports LaTeX packages and contains the settings that format the document.
You do not need to fiddle with these settings most of the time, so you may want to keep the settings out of sight and out of mind.
You also do not want to inadvertently copy or paste anything into this area.
